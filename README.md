## 🧠 Text Classification using Synthetic Data

### **Overview**

This project focuses on **topic classification** of short text samples using a synthetic dataset named **`synthetic_text_data`**.
The model is trained to categorize texts into predefined topics such as **Entertainment**, **Politics**, **Sports**, and **Technology**.
It aims to explore text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques for natural language tasks.
